[USAspending API](https://api.usaspending.gov/) offers an interactive way for active citizens to query relevant federal spending data on a variety of fields. People can query data by geography, type of federal spending, CFDA program number, and much more. [Click here a tutorial](https://rpubs.com/cenuno/USAspendingAPI) on querying the data for FY17 Austin, Texas.
